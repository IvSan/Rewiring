### General idea
The house has old electrical setup, it has to upgraded to modern one, safe and future-proof.

### Earthing
I’ve bought an electrical earthing tester and collected some initial data. It looks like there is an earth connection in the sockets in the kitchen, bathroom, basement, and the workshop on the first floor. I can’t say how reliable these connections are, I don’t have the proper equipment to verify that, so I hope electrician can check them properly. All unearthed socket should become earthed.

### Sockets count

Total non-earthened sockets: 30  

### Metercast
Upgrade the metercast to a modern and safe one, with RCD protection and everything else required.
Make sure that new setup is based on three-phase grid connection.

### Action points
Main tasks:  
1.1) Install proper earthing in all rooms where it’s missing, ideally without having to cut into the walls, though we’ll see what’s possible.  
1.2) Replace all unearthened sockets with new earthened ones. Exact list of sockets in each room will come a bit later.  
1.3) Upgrade the metercast.  

Additional work:  
2.1) Run a new line/lines from the metercast to the new kitchen (with induction stove).  
2.2) Add a new line/lines from the metercast to the carport, for heavy load use, with normal sockets and a three-phase socket.  
2.3) Add sockets and wiring for lighting in the new room on the third floor.  
2.4) A new separate outdoor line is needed for backyard use (there is already some wire sticking from the ground).  
2.5) A group for future solar panels. No wire for now as I don't know exact location yet.  
2.6) A group for future AC. No wire for now as I don't know exact location yet.  
2.7) At least 4 spare group spaces for future use (EV charger for example).  
2.8) If possible, I’d like to have a clear diagram or documentation showing how everything is connected.
